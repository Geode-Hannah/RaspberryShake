 Run this command to make the script executable:

chmod +x check_zerotier.sh

 
# The shake has crontab installed, which can be used to automatically run programs.

try crontab -e and if it is working it will open a new crontab file in a text editor, add this line to that file with the correct file path in place of the CHANGETOROOT..
